# React + Vite

This minimal setup provides a starting point for building React applications with Vite, enabling Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and basic ESLint configuration.

# Features

- <b>Vite:</b> Delivers instantaneous updates to frameworks like Vue and React without full page reloads, preserving application state through its HMR API.
- <b>React:</b> Builds efficient, reusable UIs with component-based architecture, virtual DOM, JSX syntax, and a strong community, emphasizing declarative updates.

# Prerequisites:

- Node.js (version 14.18 or higher)
- npm (or yarn)

# Installation:

1. Clone this repository or create a new project directory.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies.

# Development: 

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ``` (or `yarn dev`)
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Changes you make to your React components will be reflected automatically.

# Build for Production: 

1. Create a production-ready build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ``` (or `yarn build`)
2. The build output will be placed in the `dist` directory.

# Official Vite React Plugins: 

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc/blob/main/README.md): Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

# Project Structure

This project uses React and Vite. Below is an overview of the directory structure and key files in this project.

## Directory Structure

- **`public`** : This folder contains static assets that are directly accessible in the browser, such as your main HTML file (`index.html`).

- **`src`** : This folder contains the source code for your React application.

- **`assets` (Optional)** : This folder can hold static assets used by your components, like images or fonts.

- **`components`** : This folder stores your reusable React components that build up your UI.

## Key Files

- **`App.css` (Optional)** : This file contains global CSS styles applied throughout your application.

- **`index.css` (Optional)** : This file contains styles specific to the main application component (`main.jsx`).

- **`main.jsx`** : This is the entry point of your React application. It usually renders other components that make up your UI.

- **`.eslintrc.cjs`** : This file configures ESLint, a tool that helps identify and enforce coding standards.

- **`.gitignore`** : This file specifies patterns to be excluded from version control using Git.

- **`package.json`** : This file lists the project's dependencies (libraries your project relies on) and scripts (automated tasks you can run using `npm run`).

- **`vite.config.js`** : This file configures Vite, the build tool used in this project.

Feel free to explore these directories and files to understand the structure of the project better.

# Additional Considerations: 

- This setup can be extended to include features like routing, state management, and styling libraries as needed.
- Consider using a linter and formatter like ESLint and Prettier for improved code style and maintainability.
- Explore testing frameworks like Jest or Vitest for unit and integration testing.
- For production deployment, consult the Vite documentation for optimal server configuration.
